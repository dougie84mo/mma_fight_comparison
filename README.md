# _**UFC fighter comparison**_

### Fight Comparison is a project that helps in users with the analysis of mixed martial arts fights. Most especially UFC.

Comparisons open browsers with videos in order to compare previous fights simultaneously. Highlights, press conference or interviews, and top-finishes if possible. Side-by-side record comparison. 
Stare down video if available and odds for fight 

1. Start by running the command `python main.py`

2. Input the UFC Fight event that you would like to analyze, and then input the fight in that event. 

- Fight Comparison uses _sherdog.com_ as the main source of fights, fighter list and records as most of the data for the project.

- The remaining usage of comparison data uses Google searches for video, most likely Youtube of course.
